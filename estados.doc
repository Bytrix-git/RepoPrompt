The prompt may look like the following:

Example prompt

    (master↑3|✚1): on branch master, ahead of remote by 3 commits, 1 file changed but not staged
    (status|●2): on branch status, 2 files staged
    (master|✚7…): on branch master, 7 files changed, some files untracked
    (master|✖2✚3): on branch master, 2 conflicts, 3 files changed
    (master|⚑2): on branch master, 2 stash entries
    (experimental↓2↑3|✔): on branch experimental; your branch has diverged by 3 commits, remote by 2 commits; the repository is otherwise clean
    (:70c2952|✔): not on any branch; parent commit has hash 70c2952; the repository is otherwise clean

Prompt Structure

By default, the general appearance of the prompt is::

(<branch> <upstream branch> <branch tracking>|<local status>)

The symbols are as follows:

    Local Status Symbols
        ✔: repository clean
        ●n: there are n staged files
        ✖n: there are n files with merge conflicts
        ✖-n: there are n staged files waiting for removal
        ✚n: there are n changed but unstaged files
        …n: there are n untracked files
        ⚑n: there are n stash entries
    Upstream branch
        Shows the remote tracking branch
        Disabled by default
        Enable by setting GIT_PROMPT_SHOW_UPSTREAM=1
    Branch Tracking Symbols
        ↑n: ahead of remote by n commits
        ↓n: behind remote by n commits
        ↓m↑n: branches diverged, other by m commits, yours by n commits
        L: local branch, not remotely tracked
    Branch Symbol:
    When the branch name starts with a colon :, it means it's actually a hash, not a branch (although it should be pretty clear, unless you name your branches like hashes :-)
